    "stage2Title": "Development Kick-off",
    "stage2Description": "We start by designing the digital architecture — creating a \"blueprint\" of the future solution. Then we move on to prototyping: developing and testing the first working version, which becomes the foundation for further development. This is an iterative process: from conceptual diagrams to a tangible prototype.",
    "stage3Title": "Development",
    "stage3Description": "We regularly release intermediate versions of the product so that you can evaluate progress and provide timely feedback to keep the project on track. Each build becomes more precise thanks to your input. This is not just development, but co-creation: we continuously gather your feedback to ensure the final product fully meets your business goals.",
    "stage4Title": "Documentation",
    "stage4Description": "Alongside development, we create a complete documentation package: from technical specifications to user-friendly manuals for end users. This includes step-by-step guides, usage examples, and answers to frequently asked questions — ensuring your team can comfortably adopt and work with the new tool.",
    "stage5Title": "Delivery of Results",
    "stage5Description": "After development is completed, we deliver the final plugin to you, including all necessary components: installation files, technical documentation, and user manuals. Further integration is fully adapted to your company's workflows and BIM models.",
    "stage6Title": "Integration. Configuration. Support.",
    "stage6Description": "Once the plugin is fully ready, we provide everything needed for operation: final build packages, complete documentation, and one year of guaranteed technical support. For 12 months, our specialists promptly fix any discovered issues and provide you with technical assistance.",
